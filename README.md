# Project_ENSIBS_Todolist
A dynamic todolist with localStorage

My WEB page has the following features:
• Add a task to do
• Mark a task as complete
• Delete a task
• Show according to selection: all tasks, completed tasks or uncompleted tasks
• A navigation menu (home, contact, help) but which does not lead to any other page because I did not do them.

Explanation by example: Your wife has asked you to go buy what she needs to make a strawberry pie
You have to buy milk, strawberries, shortbread.

You go to my web page and you enter where there is marked "Tasks" in gray the ingredients.
So first you enter milk then with your mouse you click on the '+' button and the ingredient appears at the bottom.
You do the same with the strawberries and the shortcrust pastry.
Once the milk is in the box, there is no need to buy it, so you click on the 'check' and the ingredient is crossed out
You do the same for strawberries
You get lost in your shopping list between what remains to buy and what you have already taken.
You select with the drop-down menu "To do" and therefore only the shortbread dough is displayed.
You finally find the dough and check off the item.
Once at home you prepare the list for the next time so you select in the menu 'All tasks'.
They all reappear and you click on the 'delete' for it to be deleted.

Here you know how to use my todo list. It will also allow you that when you close the page and reopen it your tasks that you
would not have deleted either still there.
